# Import Census Tract Data
# Consult nhgis0013_ds82_1950_tract_codebook.txt codebook file to determine that
# column B0F001 contains Median Income in 1949. Rename this MedianHHIncome for clarity.
# Will need to figure out what the income variables are called
# for each new year of data you download from the codebook that comes with
# each NHGIS download.
# Select only MedianHHIncome and GISJOIN variables. GISJOIN is the variable that
# allows you to join the census tract median income data with the shapefile data.
# Also drop census tracts which reported 0 median income

# Michigan FIPS code for more information.
# Need to have spdplyr package loaded to use tidyverse commands on
